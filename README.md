**Website:** [Houston Crime Analysis](https://sites.google.com/view/houston-crime-analysis/home?authuser=0)  

## 🚔 Overview  

Houston, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., faces complex crime patterns that evolve over time. This project leverages **data-driven techniques** to analyze crime trends, identify hotspots, and provide actionable insights for law enforcement, policymakers, and citizens.  

By integrating **machine learning, geospatial analytics, and predictive modeling**, we aim to transform raw crime data into meaningful intelligence.  

## 📊 Key Research Areas  

- **Crime Trend Analysis** 📈: Investigating fluctuations in crime rates over time.  
- **Geospatial Crime Mapping** 🗺️: Identifying crime hotspots across different Houston neighborhoods.  
- **Predictive Crime Modeling** 🤖: Forecasting future crime trends using ML algorithms.  
- **Temporal Crime Patterns** ⏳: Understanding crime occurrence based on time of day, day of the week, and seasonal variations.  
- **Crime & Socioeconomic Factors** 🏙️: Examining correlations between crime rates and factors like income, unemployment, and education levels.  

## 🔬 Methodologies  

We use a combination of **data science, visualization, and AI** to derive insights:  

- **Geospatial Analysis** (GIS, Heatmaps, Crime Density Estimation)  
- **Time-Series Forecasting** (ARIMA, LSTMs, Prophet)  
- **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks)  
- **Crime Pattern Clustering** (K-Means, DBSCAN)  
- **Interactive Dashboards** (Power BI, Tableau) for real-time visualization  

## 🏛️ Data Sources  

- **Houston Police Department (HPD) Crime Reports**  
- **FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Data**  
- **Houston Open Data Portal**  
- **Census Bureau Socioeconomic Data**
